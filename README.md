# API Homework Thoughts (Yuttakarn Limleartvate)
## Part 1 - Personal Finance Planner
### Collect Crypto Prices Using the **requests** Library
I used JSON and grabbed the prices with library mechanics. I don't know if it is efficient. However, I was able to achieve an ending answer.
### Collect Investment Data Using Alpaca: **SPY** (stocks) and **AGG** (bonds)
This one was easier as alpacas was simpler to fetch data and lessen the crowding through index removal.
### Saving Health Analysis
I just did some basic stuff and created a library so that it showcases the shares and crypto when both are added up. Later on it is just basic information.
##Part 2 - Retirement Planning
### Monte Carlo Simulation
This was simple however it took a while for it to work.
### Retirement Analysis
I copy and pasted the answer twice since I have linked the initial investment to the equation.
